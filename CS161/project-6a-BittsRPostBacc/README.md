# project-6a

Write a function named find_median that takes as a parameter a list of numbers.  The function should return the statistical median of those numbers, which will require it to sort the list.  If you're not familiar with calculating the median, please [look at the definition](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Median.html).  Remember that the calculation is different for odd and even groups of values. Also remember that the same group of numbers should always have the **same** median, regardless of what order the numbers were listed in.

For example, it could be used like this:
```
some_nums = [13,7,-3,82,4]
result = find_median(some_nums)
```

The file must be named: find_median.py

# project-6b

Write a function named add_surname that takes as a parameter a list of first names.  **It should use a list comprehension** to return a list that contains only those names that start with a "K", but with the surname "Kardashian" added to each one, with a space between the first and last names.  You may assume that all names in the list begin with a capital letter.  For example, if the original list is:
```
["Kiki", "Krystal", "Pavel", "MaryKay", "Annie", "Koala"]
```
Then the list that is returned should be:
```
['Kiki Kardashian', 'Krystal Kardashian', 'Koala Kardashian']
```
The file must be named: add_surname.py

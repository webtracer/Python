# project-7a

Write a function named square_list that takes as a parameter a list of numbers and replaces each value with the square of that value. It should not return anything - it should mutate the original list.

Your function could be used like this:
```
nums = [7, -3, 12, 9]
square_list(nums)
print(nums)  # This should print [49, 9, 144, 81]
```

The file must be named: square_list.py

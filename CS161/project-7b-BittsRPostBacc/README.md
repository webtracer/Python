# project-7b

Write a function named reverse_list that takes as a parameter a list and reverses the order of the elements in that list. It should not return anything - it should mutate the original list.  This can be done trivially using slices, but **your function must not use any slicing**.

Your function could be used like this:
```
vals = [7, -3, 12, 9]
reverse_list(vals)
print(vals)  # This should print [9, 12, -3, 7]
```

The file must be named: reverse_list.py
